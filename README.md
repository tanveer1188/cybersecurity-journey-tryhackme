### 🚀 Tanveer’s TryHackMe Cybersecurity Journey  
Daily Learning • Hands-on Labs • Documented Progress  

# cybersecurity-journey-tryhackme
A daily record of my cybersecurity journey using TryHackMe. This repo includes hands-on labs, notes, writeups, SOC investigations, threat hunting practice, and weekly progress summaries.

# 🚀 My TryHackMe Cybersecurity Journey (Daily Progress)

This repository is my daily manual log of learning cybersecurity through TryHackMe.  
I update it step by step with the rooms I complete, the skills I learn, and the outcomes I achieve.  

My goal is to build strong skills in:
- Offensive Security (Pentesting)
- Active Directory Attacks
- Privilege Escalation
- Web Exploitation
- SOC Operations & Blue Teaming
- Threat Hunting & Log Analysis
- Incident Response & Reporting

Everything in this repo is written in my own words so I can track my growth honestly and consistently.
